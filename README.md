## Getting Started

Once you've installed Visual Studio Code, Jupyter, and Python as an isolated environment, you'll be able to begin following along with any of my Jupyter Notebook tutorials.

The first time you run one of the Jupyter Notebook tutorials, you'll be asked to:

1. Select a Python Environment
2. Select the Kernel you'd like to use.

Pay attention to the path you're selectingâ€”the Python version you installed in the last step, should appear in this step and contain a `~/.pyenv` prefix.

All of the `.pyenv` installed versions of Python will be grouped under the "PyEnv Env" heading (notice the blue text to the right in the purple box).
